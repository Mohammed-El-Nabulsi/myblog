title: Small communication advice for scientists starting a career in business
---

A few days ago I was meeting a friend who had recently finished her degree in theoretical Physics and moved to a full-time position as a digital analyst. At some point in our conversation we started talking about the more frustrating parts of being employed in a company as opposed to being a university-funded scientist. Among other things, she pointed out a very interesting issue where she stated that her thinking process just does not seem to align with business requirements. For her, statements had to be logically sound, conscise and complete - this is part of the scientific drill, right? Apparently this led to bloated emails and prolonged conversations that of course are not desirable in a business setting - everything must be concise, quick. Decisions must be made, not discussed forever. Should she change her mindset and start writing less sound/complete emails?

This reminded me of the time when I did the switch from science to business. I just had finished a number of courses in higher mathematics and started a part time job as a software engineer. I had this constant urge to construct quas-formal proofs in written conversations which led to walls over walls of text; in hindsight I can be happy if people had only skimmed these emails.

Now, soon-to-be 10 years later, I think I have found an effective way of dealing with this conflict. While I still try to construct formal proof in my written conversation my emails have become much more digestable. And following along the advice I gave my friend at this point I'd like to share with you the following:

I think that scientists are extremely capable of great success in the business world. But it's crucial that they utilize their skills correctly for maximum impact. Nowadays, when I write an important email I always construct or sketch a quasi-formal proof first. That way I am operating on a logical structure with all the information necessary. But before I send out the email I take a step back and optimize for my intent: Is it about selling something? Then maybe reduce choices or apply the [popcorn pricing scheme](https://marketfit.co/the-psychology-of-popcorn-pricing-2). It it about helping someone? Then ask youself that their level of knowlege is and rebuild your text to perfectly fit their skill level. I always end up reducing content and rephrasing until the email has become short, concise and understandable for its intended purpose. And I think that logically skilled perople can become very good at making these kind of optimizations with just a little ob-the-job practice.

title: Small communication advice for scientists starting a career in business
---

A few days ago I was meeting a friend who had recently finished her degree in theoretical Physics and moved to a full-time position as a digital analyst. At some point in our conversation we started talking about the more frustrating parts of being employed in a company as opposed to being a university-funded scientist. Among other things, she pointed out a very interesting issue where she's afraid her thinking process just does not seem to align with business requirements. For her, statements had to be logically sound, conscise and complete - this is part of the scientific drill, right? Apparently this led to bloated emails and prolonged conversations that of course are not desirable in a business setting - everything must be concise, quick. Decisions must be made, not discussed forever. So should she change her mindset and start writing less sound/complete emails?

This reminded me of the time when I did the switch from science to business. I just had finished a number of courses in higher mathematics and started a part time job as a software engineer. These courses had drilled me to have the same mindset as my friend had described. But now, soon-to-be 10 years later, I think I have found an effective way of dealing with this conflict. While I still try to construct formal proof in my written conversation, my emails have become much more digestable. And following along the advice I gave my friend at this point I'd like to share with you the following:

## First make use of your logical skills and then adapt
I think that scientists are extremely capable of great success in the business world. But it's crucial that they utilize their skills correctly for maximum impact. Let's take writing an email as an example. Nowadays, when I write an important email I always construct or sketch a quasi-formal proof first. That way I am operating on a logical structure with all the information at hand. But before I hit send I take a step back and optimize for intent: 

- Is it about selling something? Then maybe reduce choices and apply the [popcorn pricing scheme](https://marketfit.co/the-psychology-of-popcorn-pricing-2).
- Is it about helping someone? Then ask youself what their level of knowlege is and rebuild your text to fit their skill level. 
- Maybe you need to convince someone to do something for you? In this case try to be as friendly as possible and maybe adapt the [salami tactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_slicing_tactics). 

I always end up reducing content and rephrasing until the email has become short, concise and understandable for its intended purpose. And dividing the email-writing process into this simple two-step process makes it very easy and actually fun to apply optimizations, mental models or best practices to make sure the email is being read and having the biggest possible impact. I am convinced that logically skilled people can become very good at making these kind of optimizations with just a little on-the-job practice.

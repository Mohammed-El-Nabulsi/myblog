            "title": "Small communication advice for scientists starting a career in business",
            "content": "A few days ago I was meeting a friend who had recently finished her degree in theoretical Physics and moved to a full-time position as a digital analyst. At some point in our conversation we started talking about the more frustrating parts of being employed in a company as opposed to being a university-funded scientist. Among other things, she pointed out a very interesting issue where she’s afraid her thinking process just does not seem to align with business requirements. For her, statements had to be logically sound, conscise and complete - this is part of the scientific drill, right? Apparently this led to bloated emails and prolonged conversations that of course are not desirable in a business setting - everything must be concise, quick. Decisions must be made, not discussed forever. So should she change her mindset and start writing less sound/complete emails? . This reminded me of the time when I did the switch from science to business. I just had finished a number of courses in higher mathematics and started a part time job as a software engineer. These courses had drilled me to have the same mindset as my friend had described. But now, soon-to-be 10 years later, I think I have found an effective way of dealing with this conflict. While I still try to construct formal proof in my written conversation, my emails have become much more digestable. And following along the advice I gave my friend at this point I’d like to share with you the following: . First make use of your logical skills and then adapt . I think that scientists are extremely capable of great success in the business world. But it’s crucial that they utilize their skills correctly for maximum impact. Let’s take writing an email as an example. Nowadays, when I write an important email I always construct or sketch a quasi-formal proof first. That way I am operating on a logical structure with all the information at hand. But before I hit send I take a step back and optimize for intent: . Is it about selling something? Then maybe reduce choices and apply the popcorn pricing scheme. | Is it about helping someone? Then ask youself what their level of knowlege is and rebuild your text to fit their skill level. | Maybe you need to convince someone to do something for you? In this case try to be as friendly as possible and maybe adapt the salami tactic. | . I always end up reducing content and rephrasing until the email has become short, concise and understandable for its intended purpose. And dividing the email-writing process into this simple two-step process makes it very easy and actually fun to apply optimizations, mental models or best practices to make sure the email is being read and having the biggest possible impact. I am convinced that logically skilled people can become very good at making these kind of optimizations with just a little on-the-job practice. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .
